---

# Validation

Config Validator runs the following checks for every pathway (source chain → destination chain).

## Peers

- **What:** Peer addresses must be set on **both** sides of the pathway.
- **Pass:** Source OApp has `getPeer(dstEid)` set to the destination OApp address, and destination OApp has `getPeer(srcEid)` set to the source OApp address; addresses match.
- **Fail:** Missing peer on one side, or addresses don't match (wrong format or wrong contract).

Common cause of **NotInitializable** or **Dst OApp Not Found** is incorrect or missing `setPeer()` on one chain.

## DVNs (Decentralized Verifier Networks)

- **What:** The set of DVN providers must be **identical** on source and destination for the pathway.
- **Pass:** Same list of DVN addresses, in the same order, on both chains.
- **Fail:** Different DVNs, different order, or missing on one side.

**DVN Mismatch** in LayerZero Scan means send and receive config don't use the same DVN set.

## Executor

- **What:** Executor must be set on the **destination** side so messages can be executed.
- **Pass:** Executor address is set and not zero.
- **Fail:** Executor missing or zero.

## Block confirmations

- **What:** Outbound confirmations (source) must be **≥** inbound confirmations (destination).
- **Pass:** `outboundConfirmations >= inboundConfirmations`.
- **Fail:** Outbound &lt; inbound (leads to **Block Confirmations Mismatch**).

## How the report is built

For each pair of chains (A, B), the validator:

1. Reads on-chain config (peers, DVN set, executor, confirmations) for both A and B.
2. Runs the four checks above for the pathway A → B (and implicitly B → A for symmetry).
3. Adds each result to the report with status `pass`, `fail`, or `warn`.

The summary counts **errors** (fail) and **warnings** (warn). Exit code is non-zero if there is at least one error.
