# Enforced Options

Config Validator can check that **MessageExecutionOptions** (and Composer-related config) are present and sane where required, so you avoid "Missing enforced options" and execution failures.

## What are enforced options?

LayerZero allows OApps to require certain **options** on messages (e.g. gas limits for `lzReceive` or `lzCompose`). If the pathway is configured to **enforce** options for the SEND message type, those options must be set; otherwise messages can be blocked or fail at execution.

## What is checked

- **Enforced options:** If the pathway requires enforced options for SEND, the validator ensures they are set (no "Missing enforced options").
- **Gas / execution options:** Where derivable from config, gas limits or execution options for `lzReceive` / `lzCompose` are checked to be present and within safe bounds (e.g. min/max thresholds).

Results are added to the same report as **warnings** or **errors**. Fix generation can suggest "set enforced options" or point to the LayerZero docs.

## Using in the CLI

Enforced-options checks run as part of `validate`. If your OApp uses enforced options or Composer, ensure you run validation after configuring them; the report will include any missing or invalid options.
