# OFT Checks

When your OApp is an **OFT** (Omnichain Fungible Token), Config Validator can run additional checks so pathway config is consistent for token transfers.

## Enabling OFT checks

**CLI:** Add the `--oft` flag:

```bash
npx lz-config-validator validate \
  -d ethereum:0x... -d arbitrum:0x... \
  --oft
```

**SDK:** Pass `oft: true`:

```ts
const report = await validateOApp({
  deployments: [...],
  oft: true,
});
```

## What is checked

### Shared decimals

- **What:** Shared decimals configuration must be consistent across the pathway (source and destination).
- **Why:** Mismatched decimals lead to incorrect amounts or reverts on transfer.

### Native cap / fee config

- **What:** If the OFT exposes native drop cap or fee settings, they are validated to be set and within expected bounds where applicable.
- **Why:** Prevents "NativeAmountExceedsCap" or misconfigured fees.

### Pathway symmetry

- **What:** Same peer/OApp addressing on both sides for the OFT (in addition to the standard peer check).
- **Why:** Ensures the OFT contract on chain A is correctly set as peer on chain B and vice versa.

## When to use

Use `--oft` (or `oft: true`) when you are validating an OFT deployment (e.g. MintBurnOFT, NativeOFT, OFT Adapter). For a generic OApp that is not an OFT, you can omit it.
