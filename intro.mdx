# Config Validator

Config Validator is a CLI and SDK that validates [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network) OApp configuration across all deployment pathways. It automates the [integration checklist](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/tools/integration-checklist) so you can catch misconfigurations before messages get **Blocked** or fail with **NotInitializable**, **DVN Mismatch**, or **Block Confirmations Mismatch**.

## Why it exists

LayerZero deployments require configuring **peers**, **DVNs**, **Executor**, and **block confirmations** in **both directions** for every pathway. The checklist has 20+ items that must be manually verified. A single mistake (e.g. DVN set on source but not destination, or missing peer on one chain) leads to blocked messages and hard-to-debug errors.

Config Validator:

- Reads on-chain config from your OApp on each chain
- Compares source and destination for every pathway
- Reports pass/fail for peers, DVNs, executor, and confirmations
- Can generate **fix suggestions** (e.g. `setPeer`, `setConfig`) and optional calldata or a dry-run script

## What you can do

- **Validate** — Run `validate` with your deployments and get a report across all pathways.
- **Fix** — Use `--fix-mode=report|calldata|script` to get suggested fixes or calldata.
- **OFT checks** — Use `--oft` for shared decimals, native cap, and pathway symmetry.
- **Snapshot & drift** — Save config to a JSON snapshot and run `drift` in CI to detect unexpected changes.
