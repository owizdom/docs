# Troubleshooting

## DVN mismatch

**Symptom:** LayerZero Scan shows **Blocked** or "DVN Mismatch"; validation report shows `dvns: fail` for a pathway.

**Cause:** Source and destination do not use the same DVN set (or same order).

**Fix:**

1. Run `validate --fix-mode=report` to get suggested fixes.
2. Ensure `setConfig` (or equivalent) is called with the **same** list of DVN addresses in the **same order** on both chains for that pathway.
3. Re-run validation to confirm.

## Peer missing or wrong

**Symptom:** **NotInitializable** or "Dst OApp Not Found"; validation report shows `peers: fail`.

**Cause:** `setPeer()` was not called on one or both sides, or the peer address/EID is wrong.

**Fix:**

1. Run `validate --fix-mode=report` to see which chain is missing the peer.
2. Call `setPeer(remoteEid, remoteOAppAddress)` on **both** OApps (source and destination). Use the correct endpoint ID (EID) for the remote chain.
3. Re-run validation.

## Executor missing

**Symptom:** Messages never execute on destination; validation report shows `executor: fail` for destination chain.

**Cause:** Executor is not set on the destination OApp/config.

**Fix:**

1. Set the Executor address on the destination side (via `setConfig` or the appropriate setter).
2. Re-run validation.

## Block confirmations mismatch

**Symptom:** "Block Confirmations Mismatch"; validation report shows `confirmations: fail`.

**Cause:** Outbound confirmations (source) are **less than** inbound confirmations (destination).

**Fix:**

1. Ensure outbound confirmations ≥ inbound confirmations for the pathway.
2. Update config on source and/or destination so the condition holds.
3. Re-run validation.

## NotEnoughNative / gas

**Symptom:** Send fails with "NotEnoughNative" or similar gas/fee error.

**Cause:** This is a **fee/gas** issue, not a peer/DVN/executor config issue. Config Validator does not estimate gas or fees.

**Fix:** Use a gas estimation tool or LayerZero `quote()` to get required native fee and pass enough `msg.value`. For a dedicated fee estimator, see the [Gas Simulator](/gas-simulator/intro).

## RPC or timeout errors

**Symptom:** Validation fails with network/timeout errors when reading chain config.

**Cause:** Missing or slow RPC URLs for some chains.

**Fix:** Pass `rpcUrls` in the SDK (e.g. `validateOApp({ deployments, rpcUrls: { ethereum: 'https://...', arbitrum: 'https://...' } })`). CLI may support `--rpc` or env vars depending on implementation; see [CLI reference](/cli/reference).
